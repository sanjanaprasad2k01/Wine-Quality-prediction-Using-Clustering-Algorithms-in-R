# Wine-Quality-prediction-Using-Clustering-Algorithms-in-R
This Project uses two datasets of vinho verde wine to predict the wine type, red or white, and the quality based on physicochemical properties. Quality is a subjective measure, predicted using 3 factors
Exploratory data analysis is performed in 3 major steps
n data preparation, the datasets are downloaded and imported in R. In this phase, the training and testing sets are created and they will be used during the model building.

In data exploration and visualization we look for features that may provide good prediction results. The best predictors have low distribution overlapping area and low correlation among them.

Modeling starts explaining very simple models and gradually moves to more complex ones.
Other important machine learning concepts, such as ensemble and cross validation, are also discussed. Clustering is unsupervised method,
